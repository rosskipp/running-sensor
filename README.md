# Running Incline sensor

The goal of this project is to build a sensor that can be worn on a shoe that can sense the incline both, pitch and roll, of your run.

The motivation is that my "normal" running route has some sidewalks with incline, and lately I've been having issues with ankle pain, and I'd like to know if the incline of these sidewalks (roll direction) is contributing some amount of
asymmetry in my body.
